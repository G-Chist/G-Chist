# Hello everyone!

I’m currently studying Computer Science & Robotics Engineering at [WPI](https://www.wpi.edu/) (Class of 2027)

Interested in robotics engineering, machine learning, evolutionary computation, and computer graphics; I mostly use Python :)

I read philosophy, travel, and sometimes edit Wikipedia in my free time
