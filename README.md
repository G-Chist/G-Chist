# Hello everyone!

I’m currently studying Computer Science & Robotics Engineering at [WPI](https://www.wpi.edu/) (Class of 2027)

Interested in engineering, machine learning, optimization problems, and procedural generation; I mostly use Python :)

I read philosophy, travel, play video games, and write for Wikipedia in my free time

Planning to pursue a Master’s Degree in Robotics Engineering

Looking for a computer science / robotics - related internship or co-op!
